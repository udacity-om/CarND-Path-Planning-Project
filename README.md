# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

## Implementation
### Scene Perception
The simulator provides sensor fusion data containing information about other cars on the same side of the ego vehicle's road. Looping through the sensor fusion data, I first extract the target vehicle's lane by looking at target's `d` value. [line 279-301]

Then I calculate the target's speed using the target's `x` and `y` velocity componenets. The simulator also provides the remaining path of the previous path provided to the simulator. Using the target's current position and speed, I predict the target's future position. Here the future referes to the end of the previous path. [line 304-310]

Using the target's predicted postion, I check if the target could be within 30m, both front and behind, of ego vehicle. I also find the target's lane and keep track of the closest target's speed on either side of the ego vehicle's lane, if plausible. This will help later in deciding to which lane to move to if the ego is in center lane and has to change lanes. [line 314-359]

### Behaviour Planning
If all is good and if there is no vehicle in front of the ego vehicle then the ego vehicle will maintain the same lane and keep increasing its speed until it reaches close to the maximum speed limit of 50MPH. But if it is the case where there is a vehicle in front of the ego vehicle then I check if I can change to either left or right lane. If both lanes are clear, meaning there is no predicted target which could be within 30m of the ego vehicle, then the lane which has faster moving traffic is choosen. If only left lane is clear then the left lane is choosen and if only right lane is clear then the right lane is choosen. If either lane is not clear then the ego will maintain the current lane but will keep reducing its speed. [line 362-412]

Please note that the ego vehicle will not move to left if it is already in the left most lane and it will not move to the right if it is already in the right most lane.

### Prepare Path
I create a list of widely spaced waypoints, evenly spaced at 30m. Later I will interpolate these waypoints with the spline and fill it with more points so as to control speed and for smoother path.

Starting point of the waypoints will either be the ego vehicle's current and previous position or will be couple of end points of the previous path depending on the number of points available in the previous path. Adding the points from previous path will lead to smoother transition. I then add 3 more points spaced evenly at 30m in Frenet co-ordinate system. [line 422-475]

The 5 points from the previous step are in global co-ordinate system. For easier mathematical calculations and for good behaviour of the spline function, I transform these points to local co-ordinate system where the ego vehicle will be at the origin with `x` as the horizontal axis. [line 484-492]

A spline is created with the above 5 points. A total of 50 points is sent to the simulator as path planner points. If there are points available from the prevous path then they are first added to the current path planner points list. The remaining points are extracted from the spline function using `x` values in between ego vehicle's current position and 30m ahead in `x` direction. An example of the extraction is shown below:

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
